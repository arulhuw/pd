Our mindset is a combination of the beliefs and feelings that determine our view or attitude to life.
Our general wellbeing is heavily influenced by the choices we make,
especially those we make relating to our attitude. 
This attitude to life underpins our demeanour, 
colours our thinking and determines our approach to lifeâ€™s opportunities and challenges.
Attitude also impacts how others engage with us,
and can be the determining factor affecting a positive or negative dialogue.
When individuals are dealing with a very difficult and stressful situation, 
that stress can be reduced if those involved bring a positive attitude to the table.
Thus people are more likely to gravitate towards individuals with a positive attitude.
