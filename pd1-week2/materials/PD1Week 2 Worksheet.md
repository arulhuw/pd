TASK 6	Watch the video “How to make stress your friend” (https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend) up to 7.21 then decide which of the statements below is TRUE or FALSE:

Kelly McGonigal has always thought about stress in the same way.

The first study she discusses followed a group of individuals for 8 years to determine the way in which an individual’s perspective about stress impacted their life expectancy. 

The study found that both those who had positive views and those who had negative views of stress had the same death rate over the years.

Stress is the 15th largest cause of death in the USA.

McGonigal has the audience participate in a short social stress test to illustrate that stress impacts all participants negatively regardless of their perspective on stress.

In the Harvard university study, the cardiovascular system of participants was not adversely impacted by stress-inducing situations because they had been trained to respond more positively to stress.

McGonigal’s ultimate goals is to get the audience to reconsider how they respond to stress.
